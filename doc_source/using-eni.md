# Elastic network interfaces<a name="using-eni"></a>

An *elastic network interface* is a logical networking component in a VPC that represents a virtual network card\. It can include the following attributes:
+ A primary private IPv4 address from the IPv4 address range of your VPC
+ One or more secondary private IPv4 addresses from the IPv4 address range of your VPC
+ One Elastic IP address \(IPv4\) per private IPv4 address
+ One public IPv4 address
+ One or more IPv6 addresses
+ One or more security groups
+ A MAC address
+ A source/destination check flag
+ A description

You can create and configure network interfaces in your account and attach them to instances in your VPC\. Your account might also have *requester\-managed* network interfaces, which are created and managed by AWS services to enable you to use other resources and services\. You cannot manage these network interfaces yourself\. For more information, see [Requester\-managed network interfaces](requester-managed-eni.md)\.

This AWS resource is referred to as a *network interface* in the AWS Management Console and the Amazon EC2 API\. Therefore, we use "network interface" in this documentation instead of "elastic network interface"\. The term "network interface" in this documentation always means "elastic network interface"\.

## Network interface basics<a name="eni-basics"></a>

You can create a network interface, attach it to an instance, detach it from an instance, and attach it to another instance\. The attributes of a network interface follow it as it's attached or detached from an instance and reattached to another instance\. When you move a network interface from one instance to another, network traffic is redirected to the new instance\.

**Primary network interface**  
Each instance has a default network interface, called the *primary network interface*\. You cannot detach a primary network interface from an instance\. You can create and attach additional network interfaces\. The maximum number of network interfaces that you can use varies by instance type\. For more information, see [IP addresses per network interface per instance type](#AvailableIpPerENI)\.

**Public IPv4 addresses for network interfaces**  
In a VPC, all subnets have a modifiable attribute that determines whether network interfaces created in that subnet \(and therefore instances launched into that subnet\) are assigned a public IPv4 address\. For more information, see [IP addressing behavior for your subnet](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-ip-addressing.html#vpc-ip-addressing-subnet) in the *Amazon VPC User Guide*\. The public IPv4 address is assigned from Amazon's pool of public IPv4 addresses\. When you launch an instance, the IP address is assigned to the primary network interface that's created\.

When you create a network interface, it inherits the public IPv4 addressing attribute from the subnet\. If you later modify the public IPv4 addressing attribute of the subnet, the network interface keeps the setting that was in effect when it was created\. If you launch an instance and specify an existing network interface as the primary network interface, the public IPv4 address attribute is determined by this network interface\.

For more information, see [Public IPv4 addresses and external DNS hostnames](using-instance-addressing.md#concepts-public-addresses)\.

**Elastic IP addresses for network interface**  
If you have an Elastic IP address, you can associate it with one of the private IPv4 addresses for the network interface\. You can associate one Elastic IP address with each private IPv4 address\.

If you disassociate an Elastic IP address from a network interface, you can release it back to the address pool\. This is the only way to associate an Elastic IP address with an instance in a different subnet or VPC, as network interfaces are specific to subnets\.

**IPv6 addresses for network interfaces**  
If you associate IPv6 CIDR blocks with your VPC and subnet, you can assign one or more IPv6 addresses from the subnet range to a network interface\. Each IPv6 address can be assigned to one network interface\.

All subnets have a modifiable attribute that determines whether network interfaces created in that subnet \(and therefore instances launched into that subnet\) are automatically assigned an IPv6 address from the range of the subnet\. For more information, see [IP addressing behavior for your subnet](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-ip-addressing.html#vpc-ip-addressing-subnet) in the *Amazon VPC User Guide*\. When you launch an instance, the IPv6 address is assigned to the primary network interface that's created\.

For more information, see [IPv6 addresses](using-instance-addressing.md#ipv6-addressing)\.

**Termination behavior**  
You can set the termination behavior for a network interface that's attached to an instance\. You can specify whether the network interface should be automatically deleted when you terminate the instance to which it's attached\.

**Source/destination checking**  
Disabling source/destination checking enables an instance to handle network traffic that isn't specifically destined for the instance\. For example, instances running services such as network address translation, routing, or a firewall should disable the source/destination check attribute\. This attribute is enabled by default\.

**Monitoring IP traffic**  
You can enable a VPC flow log on your network interface to capture information about the IP traffic going to and from a network interface\. After you've created a flow log, you can view and retrieve its data in Amazon CloudWatch Logs\. For more information, see [VPC Flow Logs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/flow-logs.html) in the *Amazon VPC User Guide*\.

## Network cards<a name="network-cards"></a>

Instances with multiple network cards provide higher network performance, including bandwidth capabilities above 100 Gbps and improved packet rate performance\. Each network interface is attached to a network card\. The primary network interface must be assigned to network card index 0\.

If you enable Elastic Fabric Adapter \(EFA\) when you launch an instance that supports multiple network cards, all network cards are available\. You can assign up to one EFA per network card\. An EFA counts as a network interface\.

The following instances support multiple network cards\. All other instance types support one network card\.


| Instance type | Number of network cards | 
| --- | --- | 
| P4 | 4 | 

## IP addresses per network interface per instance type<a name="AvailableIpPerENI"></a>

The following table lists the maximum number of network interfaces per instance type, and the maximum number of private IPv4 addresses and IPv6 addresses per network interface\. The limit for IPv6 addresses is separate from the limit for private IPv4 addresses per network interface\. Not all instance types support IPv6 addressing\. Network interfaces, multiple private IPv4 addresses, and IPv6 addresses are only available for instances running in a VPC\. IPv6 addresses are public and reachable over the Internet\. For more information, see [Multiple IP addresses](MultipleIP.md)\. For more information about IPv6 in VPC, see [IP Addressing in your VPC](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-ip-addressing.html) in the *Amazon VPC User Guide*\.

### Attaching a network interface to an instance<a name="attach_eni"></a>

You can attach a network interface to any of your stopped or running instances, using either the **Instances** or **Network Interfaces** pages of the Amazon EC2 console\. Alternatively, you can specify an existing network interface or attach an additional network interface when you [launch an instance](launching-instance.md)\.

If the public IPv4 address on your instance is released, it does not receive a new one if there is more than one network interface attached to the instance\. For more information about the behavior of public IPv4 addresses, see [Public IPv4 addresses and external DNS hostnames](using-instance-addressing.md#concepts-public-addresses)\.

**To attach a network interface to an instance using the **Instances** page**

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Instances**\.

+ [Add\-EC2NetworkInterface](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/powershell/latest/reference/items/Add-EC2NetworkInterface.html) \(AWS Tools for Windows PowerShell\)

### Detaching a network interface from an instance<a name="detach_eni"></a>

You can detach a secondary network interface that is attached to an EC2 instance at any time, using either the **Instances** or **Network Interfaces** page of the Amazon EC2 console\.

**To detach a network interface from an instance using the Instances page**

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Instances**\.

1. Select the instance\.

1. Choose **Actions**, **Networking**, **Detach network interface**\.

1. Select the network interface and choose **Detach**\.

You can't use the Amazon EC2 console to detach a network interface that is attached to a resource from another service, such as an Elastic Load Balancing load balancer, a Lambda function, a WorkSpace, or a NAT gateway\. The network interfaces for those resources are deleted when the resource is deleted\.

**To detach a network interface from an instance using the Network Interfaces page**

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/ec2/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/)\.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Network Interfaces**\.

1. Select the network interface and check the description to verify that the network interface is attached to an instance, not another type of resource\. If the resource is an EC2 instance, choose **Detach**\.

   If the network interface is the primary network interface for the instance, the **Detach** button is disabled\.

1. When prompted for confirmation, choose **Yes, Detach**\.

1. If the network interface fails to detach from the instance, choose **Force detachment** and then try again\. We recommend that you choose this option only as a last resort\. Forcing a detachment can prevent you from attaching a different network interface on the same index until you restart the instance\. It can also prevent the instance metadata from reflecting that the network interface was detached until you restart the instance\.

**To detach a network interface using the command line**

You can use one of the following commands\. For more information about these command line interfaces, see [Accessing Amazon EC2](concepts.md#access-ec2)\.
+ [detach\-network\-interface](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/detach-network-interface.html) \(AWS CLI\)
