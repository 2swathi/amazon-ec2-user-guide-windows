**Q\. What purchasing option best meets my needs?**  
Amazon EC2 supports On\-Demand Instances \(the default\), Spot Instances, and Reserved Instances\. For more information, see [Instance Purchasing Options](instance-purchasing-options.md)\.

**Q\. Can I remotely manage a fleet of EC2 instances *and* machines in my hybrid environment?**  
AWS Systems Manager enables you to remotely and securely manage the configuration of your Amazon EC2 instances, and your on\-premises instances and virtual machines \(VMs\) in hybrid environments, including VMs from other cloud providers\.
