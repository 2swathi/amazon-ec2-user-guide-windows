# Monitor your policies using Amazon CloudWatch<a name="monitor-dlm-cw-metrics"></a>

You can monitor your Amazon Data Lifecycle Manager lifecycle policies using CloudWatch, which collects raw data and processes it into readable, near real\-time metrics\. You can use these metrics to see exactly how many Amazon EBS snapshots and EBS\-backed AMIs are created, deleted, and copied by your policies over time\. You can also set alarms that watch for certain thresholds, and send notifications or take actions when those thresholds are met\.

Metrics are kept for a period of 15 months, so that you can access historical information and gain a better understanding of how your lifecycle policies perform over an extended period\.

For more information about Amazon CloudWatch, see the [Amazon CloudWatch User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/)\.

## Supported metrics<a name="metrics"></a>

The `Data Lifecycle Manager` namespace includes the following metrics for Amazon Data Lifecycle Manager lifecycle policies\. The supported metrics differ by policy type\.

All metrics can be measured on the `DLMPolicyId` dimension\. The most useful statistics are `sum` and `average`, and the unit of measure is `count`\.

Choose a tab to view the metrics supported by that policy type\.

## Create a CloudWatch alarm for a policy<a name="create-alarm"></a>

You can create a CloudWatch alarm that monitors CloudWatch metrics for your policies\. CloudWatch will automatically send you a notification when the metric reaches a threshold that you specify\. You can create a CloudWatch alarm using the CloudWatch console\.

For more information about creating alarms using the CloudWatch console, see the following topic in the *Amazon CloudWatch User Guide*\.
+ [ Create a CloudWatch Alarm Based on a Static Threshold](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/ConsoleAlarms.html)
+ [ Create a CloudWatch Alarm Based on Anomaly Detection](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/Create_Anomaly_Detection_Alarm.html)

## Example use cases<a name="use-cases"></a>

The following are example use cases\.

**Topics**
+ [Example 1: ResourcesTargeted metric](#case1)
+ [Example 2: SnapshotDeleteFailed metric](#case2)
+ [Example 3: SnapshotsCopiedRegionFailed metric](#case3)

### Example 1: ResourcesTargeted metric<a name="case1"></a>

You can use the `ResourcesTargeted` metric to monitor the total number of resources that are targeted by a specific policy each time it is run\. This enables you to trigger an alarm when the number of targeted resources is below or above an expected threshold\.

For example, if you expect your daily policy to create backups of no more than `50` volumes, you can create an alarm that sends an email notification when the `sum` for `ResourcesTargeted` is greater than `50` over a `1` hour period\. In this way, you can ensure that no snapshots have been unexpectedly created from volumes that have been incorrectly tagged\.

You can use the following command to create this alarm:

```
C:\> aws cloudwatch put-metric-alarm \
--alarm-name resource-targeted-monitor \
--alarm-description "Alarm when resources targeted exceeds count 50" \
--metric-name ResourcesTargeted \
--namespace AWS/EBS \
--statistic Sum \
--period 3600 \
--threshold 50 \
--comparison-operator GreaterThanThreshold \
--dimensions "Name=DLMPolicyId,Value=policy_id" \
--evaluation-periods 1 \
--alarm-actions sns_topic_arn
```

### Example 2: SnapshotDeleteFailed metric<a name="case2"></a>

You can use the `SnapshotDeleteFailed` metric to monitor for failures to delete snapshots as per the policy's snapshot retention rule\. 

For example, if you've created a policy that should automatically delete snapshots every twelve hours, you can create an alarm that notifies your engineering team when the `sum` of `SnapshotDeletionFailed` is greater than `0` over a `1` hour period\. This could help to investigate improper snapshot retention and to ensure that your storage costs are not increased by unnecessary snapshots\.

You can use the following command to create this alarm:

```
C:\> aws cloudwatch put-metric-alarm \
--alarm-name snapshot-deletion-failed-monitor \
--alarm-description "Alarm when snapshots deletion fails" \
--metric-name SnapshotsDeleteFailed \
--namespace AWS/EBS \
--statistic Sum \
--period 3600 \
--threshold 0 \
--comparison-operator GreaterThanThreshold \
--dimensions "Name=DLMPolicyId,Value=policy_id" \
--evaluation-periods 1 \
--alarm-actions sns_topic_arn
```

### Example 3: SnapshotsCopiedRegionFailed metric<a name="case3"></a>

Use the `SnapshotsCopiedRegionFailed` metric to identify when your policies fail to copy snapshots to other Regions\.

For example, if your policy copies snapshots across Regions daily, you can create an alarm that sends an SMS to your engineering team when the `sum` of `SnapshotCrossRegionCopyFailed` is greater than `0` over a `1` hour period\. This can useful for verifying whether subsequent snapshots in the lineage were successfully copied by the policy\.

You can use the following command to create this alarm:

```
C:\> aws cloudwatch put-metric-alarm \
--alarm-name snapshot-copy-region-failed-monitor \
--alarm-description "Alarm when snapshot copy fails" \
--metric-name SnapshotsCopiedRegionFailed \
--namespace AWS/EBS \
--statistic Sum \
--period 3600 \
--threshold 0 \
--comparison-operator GreaterThanThreshold \
--dimensions "Name=DLMPolicyId,Value=policy_id" \
--evaluation-periods 1 \
--alarm-actions sns_topic_arn
```
