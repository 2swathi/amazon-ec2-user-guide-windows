# Instance Metadata and User Data<a name="ec2-instance-metadata"></a>

*Instance metadata* is data about your instance that you can use to configure or manage the running instance\. Instance metadata is divided into categories, for example, host name, events, and security groups\.

You can also use instance metadata to access *user data* that you specified when launching your instance\. For example, you can specify parameters for configuring your instance, or include a simple script\. You can build generic AMIs and use user data to modify the configuration files supplied at launch time\. For example, if you run web servers for various small businesses, they can all use the same generic AMI and retrieve their content from the Amazon S3 bucket that you specify in the user data at launch\. To add a new customer at any time, create a bucket for the customer, add their content, and launch your AMI with the unique bucket name provided to your code in the user data\. If you launch more than one instance at the same time, the user data is available to all instances in that reservation\. Each instance that is part of the same reservation has a unique `ami-launch-index` number, allowing you to write code that controls what to do\. For example, the first host might elect itself as an initial master node in a cluster\. 

EC2 instances can also include *dynamic data*, such as an instance identity document that is generated when the instance is launched\. For more information, see [Dynamic Data Categories](#dynamic-data-categories)\.

**Important**  
Although you can only access instance metadata and user data from within the instance itself, the data is not protected by authentication or cryptographic methods\. Anyone who has direct access to the instance, and potentially any software running on the instance, can view its metadata\. Therefore, you should not store sensitive data, such as passwords or long\-lived encryption keys, as user data\.

## Configuring the Instance Metadata Service<a name="configuring-instance-metadata-service"></a>

You can access instance metadata from a running instance using one of the following methods:
+ Instance Metadata Service Version 1 \(IMDSv1\) – a request/response method
+ Instance Metadata Service Version 2 \(IMDSv2\) – a session\-oriented method

By default, you can use either IMDSv1 or IMDSv2, or both\. The instance metadata service distinguishes between IMDSv1 and IMDSv2 requests based on whether, for any given request, either the `PUT` or `GET` headers, which are unique to IMDSv2, are present in that request\.

You can configure the instance metadata service on each instance such that local code or users must use IMDSv2\. When you specify that IMDSv2 must be used, IMDSv1 no longer works\. For more information, see [Configuring the Instance Metadata Options](#configuring-instance-metadata-options)\.

### How Instance Metadata Service Version 2 Works<a name="instance-metadata-v2-how-it-works"></a>

IMDSv2 uses session\-oriented requests\. With session\-oriented requests, you create a session token that defines the session duration, which can be a minimum of one second and a maximum of six hours\. During the specified duration, you can use the same session token for subsequent requests\. After the specified duration expires, you must create a new session token to use for future requests\.

The following example uses a PowerShell shell script and IMDSv2 to retrieve the top\-level instance metadata items\. The example command: 
+ Creates a session token lasting six hours \(21,600 seconds\) using the `PUT` request
+ Stores the session token header in a variable named `token`
+ Requests the top\-level metadata items using the token

```
PS C:\> $token = Invoke-RestMethod-Headers @{"X-aws-ec2-metadata-token-ttl-seconds" = "21600"} -Method PUT –Uri http://169.254.169.254/latest/api/token
```

```
PS C:\> Invoke-RestMethod -Headers @{"X-aws-ec2-metadata-token" = $token} -Method GET -Uri http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/
```

After you've created a token, you can reuse it until it expires\. In the following example command, which gets the ID of the AMI used to launch the instance, the token that is stored in `$token` in the previous example is reused\.

```
PS C:\> Invoke-RestMethod -Headers @{"X-aws-ec2-metadata-token" = $token} `
-Method GET -uri http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/ami-id
```

When you use IMDSv2 to request instance metadata, the request must include the following:

1. Use a `PUT` request to initiate a session to the instance metadata service\. The `PUT` request returns a token that must be included in subsequent `GET` requests to the instance metadata service\. The token is required to access metadata using IMDSv2\.

1. Include the token in all `GET` requests to the instance metadata service\. When token usage is set to `required`, requests without a valid token or with an expired token receive a `401 - Unauthorized` HTTP error code\. For information about changing the token usage requirement, see [modify\-instance\-metadata\-options](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/modify-instance-metadata-options.html) in the *AWS CLI Command Reference*\.
   + The token is an instance\-specific key\. The token is not valid on other EC2 instances and will be rejected if you attempt to use it outside of the instance on which it was generated\.
   + The `PUT` request must include a header that specifies the time to live \(TTL\) for the token, in seconds, up to a maximum of six hours \(21,600 seconds\)\. The token represents a logical session\. The TTL specifies the length of time that the token is valid and, therefore, the duration of the session\.
   + After a token expires, to continue accessing instance metadata, you must create a new session using another `PUT`\.
   + You can choose to reuse a token or create a new token with every request\. For a small number of requests, it might be easier to generate and immediately use a token each time you need to access the instance metadata service\. But for efficiency, you can specify a longer duration for the token and reuse it rather than having to write a `PUT` request every time you need to request instance metadata\. There is no practical limit on the number of concurrent tokens, each representing its own session\. IMDSv2 is, however, still constrained by normal instance metadata service connection and throttling limits\. For more information, see [Throttling](#instancedata-throttling)\.

HTTP `GET` and `HEAD` methods are allowed in IMDSv2 instance metadata requests\. `PUT` requests are rejected if they contain an X\-Forwarded\-For header\.

By default, the response to `PUT` requests has a response hop limit \(time to live\) of `1` at the IP protocol level\. You can adjust the hop limit using the `modify-instance-metadata-options` command if you need to make it larger\. For example, you might need a larger hop limit for backward compatibility with container services running on the instance\. For more information, see [modify\-instance\-metadata\-options](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/modify-instance-metadata-options.html) in the *AWS CLI Command Reference*\.

### Transitioning to Using Instance Metadata Service Version 2<a name="instance-metadata-transition-to-version-2"></a>

Use of Instance Metadata Service Version 2 \(IMDSv2\) is optional\. Instance Metadata Service Version 1 \(IMDSv1\) will continue to be supported indefinitely\. If you choose to migrate to using IMDSv2, we recommend that you use the following tools and transition path\. 

**Tools for helping with the transition to IMDSv2**

If your software uses IMDSv1, use the following tools to help reconfigure your software to use IMDSv2\.
+ **AWS software:** The latest versions of the AWS SDKs and CLIs support IMDSv2\. To use IMDSv2, make sure that your EC2 instances have the latest versions of the AWS SDKs and CLIs\. For information about updating the CLI, see [Upgrading to the latest version of the AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-linux.html#install-linux-awscli-upgrade) in the *AWS Command Line Interface User Guide*\.
+ **CloudWatch**: IMDSv1 does not use token\-backed sessions\. You can track the number of calls to the instance metadata service that are not using token\-backed sessions through the CloudWatch metric `MetadataNoToken`\. This metric tracks the number of calls that are using IMDSv1\. By tracking this metric to zero, you can determine if and when all of your software has been upgraded to use IMDSv2\. For more information, see [Instance Metrics](viewing_metrics_with_cloudwatch.md#ec2-cloudwatch-metrics)\.
+ **Updates to EC2 APIs and CLIs**: For existing instances, you can use the [modify\-instance\-metadata\-options](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/modify-instance-metadata-options.html) CLI command \(or the [ModifyInstanceMetadataOptions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_ModifyInstanceMetadataOptions.html) API\) to require the use of IMDSv2\. For new instances, you can use the [run\-instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/run-instances.html) CLI command \(or the [RunInstances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_RunInstances.html) API\) and the `metadata-options` parameter to launch new instances that require the use of IMDSv2\.
+ **IAM policies and SCPs**: You can use condition keys to block users from launching new instances or from modifying running instances, unless they specify the use of IMDSv2 only\. You can also use another condition key to block subsequent API calls made with EC2 Role credentials obtained via IMDSv1\. Those condition keys, which are described in the following section, can be used either in IAM policies or AWS Organizations service control policies \(SCPs\)\. For more information, see **When all of your instances are transitioned to IMDSv2** in the following section\. 

**Recommended path to requiring IMDSv2 access**

Using the above tools, we recommend that you follow this path for transitioning to IMDSv2:

1. **At the start**

   Update the SDKs, CLIs, and your software that use Role credentials on their EC2 instances to IMDSv2\-compatible versions\. Then, change your software that directly accesses instance metadata \(in other words, that does not use an SDK\) using the IMDSv2 requests\. For information about updating the CLI, see [Upgrading to the latest version of the AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-linux.html#install-linux-awscli-upgrade) in the *AWS Command Line Interface User Guide*\.

1. **During the transition**

   Track your transition progress by looking at the CloudWatch metric `MetadataNoToken`, which shows the number of calls to IMDSv1 on your instances\. For more information, see [Instance Metrics](viewing_metrics_with_cloudwatch.md#ec2-cloudwatch-metrics)\. 

1. **When everything is ready on all instances**

   Everything is ready on all instances when the CloudWatch metric `MetadataNoToken` records zero usage\. At this stage, you can require IMDSv2 use through the [modify\-instance\-metadata\-options](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/modify-instance-metadata-options.html) command\. You can make these changes on running instances; you do not need to restart your instances\. For newly\-launched instances, you can use the [run\-instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/run-instances.html) command to specify that only IMDSv2 is to be used\. Specifying your instance metadata options is available only through the API or AWS CLI; it is currently not available via the AWS Management Console\. For more information, see [run\-instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/run-instances.html) and [modify\-instance\-metadata\-options](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/modify-instance-metadata-options.html) in the *AWS CLI Command Reference*\.

1. **When all of your instances are transitioned to IMDSv2**

   You can use an IAM condition to enforce that IAM users can't launch an instance unless it uses IMDSv2\. For more information, see **To enforce the use of IMDSv2 on all new instances** in the following section\. You can also use IAM conditions to enforce that IAM users can't modify running instances to re\-enable IMDSv1, and to enforce that the instance metadata service is available on the instance\. 

   Furthermore, you can choose an additional layer of protection to enforce the change from IMDSv1 to IMDSv2\. At the access management layer with respect to the APIs called via EC2 Role credentials, you can use a new condition key in either IAM policies or AWS Organizations service control policies \(SCPs\)\. Specifically, by using the policy condition key `ec2:RoleDelivery` with a value of `2.0` in your IAM policies, API calls made with EC2 Role credentials obtained from IMDSv1 will receive an `Access Denied` response\. The same thing can be achieved more broadly with that condition required by an SCP\. This ensures that credentials delivered via IMDSv1 cannot actually be used to call APIs because any API calls not matching the specified condition will receive an `Access Denied` error\. For more information, see [Service Control Policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_policies_scp.html) in the *AWS Organizations User Guide*\.

### Configuring the Instance Metadata Options<a name="configuring-instance-metadata-options"></a>

Instance metadata options allow you to configure new or existing instances to require the use of IMDSv2 when requesting instance metadata, specify the `PUT` response hop limit, and turn off access to instance metadata\. You can also use condition keys in an IAM policy or SCP that allows an instance to launch only if it's configured to require the use of IMDSv2, or to restrict the number of allowed hops, or to enforce that the IMDS is disabled altogether\. To configure the instance metadata options on new or existing instances, you use the AWS SDK or CLI\. For more information, see [run\-instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/run-instances.html) and [modify\-instance\-metadata\-options](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/modify-instance-metadata-options.html) in the *AWS CLI Command Reference*\.

**Note**  
You should proceed cautiously and conduct careful testing before making any changes\. Take note of the following:  
If you enforce the use of IMDSv2, applications or agents that use IMDSv1 for instance metadata access will break\.
If you turn off all access to instance metadata, applications or agents that rely on instance metadata access to function will break\.

**To enforce the use of IMDSv2 on all new instances**

To ensure that IAM users can only launch instances that require the use of IMDSv2 when requesting instance metadata, you can specify that the condition to require IMDSv2 must be met before an instance can be launched\.

The following instructions explain how to create the policy and attach it using the AWS CLI\. For instructions that use the AWS Management Console, see [Creating IAM Policies \(Console\)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_create.html#access_policies_create-start) and [Adding Permissions by Attaching Policies Directly to the User](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users_change-permissions.html#users_change_permissions-add-directly-console) in the *IAM User Guide*\.

1. Create a JSON policy document that includes the following:
   + The `ec2:RunInstances` action\. This grants an IAM user permission to launch new instances\.
   + The `ec2:MetadataHttpTokens` condition set to `required`\. This specifies that, for the instance to launch, it must be configured to require IMDSv2, which uses a secure token header for instance metadata retrieval requests\.

   The following is an example policy document\.

   ```
   {
   	"Version": "2012-10-17",
   	"Statement": [{
   		"Sid": "RunInstanceWithImdsV2Only",
   		"Effect": "Allow",
   		"Action": "ec2:RunInstances",
   		"Resource": "*",
   		"Condition": {
   			"StringEquals": {
   				"ec2:MetadataHttpTokens": "required"
   			}
   		}
   	}]
   }
   ```

1. Use the [create\-policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/iam/create-policy.html) command to create a new managed policy, and specify the JSON document that you created to use as the content for the new policy\.

   ```
   $ aws iam create-policy --policy-name my-policy --policy-document file://JSON-file-name
   ```

1. Use the [attach\-user\-policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/iam/create-policy.html) command to attach the managed policy to the specified IAM user\. For the `--user-name` parameter, specify the friendly name \(not the ARN\) of the IAM user\.

   ```
   $ aws iam attach-user-policy --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::account-id:policy/my-policy --user-name IAM-friendly-name
   ```

The `ec2:MetadataHttpTokens`, `ec2:MetadataHttpPutResponseHopLimit`, and `ec2:MetadataHttpEndpoint` IAM condition keys can also be used to control the use of the [RunInstances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_RunInstances.html) and the [ModifyInstanceMetadataOptions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_ModifyInstanceMetadataOptions.html) API and corresponding CLI\. For the valid conditions for these keys, see [run\-instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/run-instances.html) and [modify\-instance\-metadata\-options](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/modify-instance-metadata-options.html) in the *AWS CLI Command Reference*\. If a policy is created, and a parameter in the API call does not match the state specified in the policy using the condition key, the API or CLI call fails with an `Access Denied` response\. You can use the preceding example policy as an example of how to create policies with these condition keys\.

**To require the use of IMDSv2 on an existing instance**  
For existing instances, you can opt in to require that IMDSv2 is used when requesting instance metadata\. Use the [modify\-instance\-metadata\-options](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/modify-instance-metadata-options.html) CLI command and set the `http-token` parameter to `required`\.

```
aws ec2 modify-instance-metadata-options --instance-id i-1234567898abcdef0 --http-token required
```

Although we do not provide an example policy, the `ec2:MetadataHttpTokens` condition key can also be used to control the use of the [ModifyInstanceMetadataOptions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_ModifyInstanceMetadataOptions.html) API as well as the [RunInstances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_RunInstances.html) API\.

**To change the PUT response hop limit on an existing instance**  
For existing instances, you can change the settings of the `PUT` response hop limit\. Use the [modify\-instance\-metadata\-options](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/modify-instance-metadata-options.html) CLI command and set the `http-put-response-hop-limit` parameter to the required number of hops\. In the following example, the hop limit is set to `3`\.

```
aws ec2 modify-instance-metadata-options --instance-id i-1234567898abcdef0 --http-put-response-hop-limit 3
```

**To turn off access to instance metadata on an existing instance**  
For existing instances, you can turn off access to your instance metadata by disabling the HTTP endpoint of the instance metadata service, regardless of which version of the instance metadata service you are using\. You can reverse this change at any time by enabling the HTTP endpoint\. Use the [modify\-instance\-metadata\-options](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/modify-instance-metadata-options.html) CLI command and set the `http-endpoint` parameter to `disabled`\.

```
aws ec2 modify-instance-metadata-options --instance-id i-1234567898abcdef0 --http-endpoint disabled
```

## Retrieving Instance Metadata<a name="instancedata-data-retrieval"></a>

Because your instance metadata is available from your running instance, you do not need to use the Amazon EC2 console or the AWS CLI\. This can be helpful when you're writing scripts to run from your instance\. For example, you can access the local IP address of your instance from instance metadata to manage a connection to an external application\.

Instance metadata is divided into categories\. For a description of each instance metadata category, see [Instance Metadata Categories](#instancedata-data-categories)\.

To view all categories of instance metadata from within a running instance, use the following URI\.

```
http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/
```

The IP address `169.254.169.254` is a link\-local address and is valid only from the instance\. For more information, see [Link\-local address](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link-local_address) on Wikipedia\.

Note that you are not billed for HTTP requests used to retrieve instance metadata and user data\.

The command format is different, depending on whether you use IMDSv1 or IMDSv2\. By default, you can use both instance metadata services\. To require the use of IMDSv2, see [Configuring the Instance Metadata Service](#configuring-instance-metadata-service)\.

You can use PowerShell cmdlets to retrieve the URI\. For example, if you are running version 3\.0 or later of PowerShell, use the following cmdlet\.

------
#### [ IMDSv2 ]

```
PS C:\> $token = Invoke-RestMethod-Headers @{"X-aws-ec2-metadata-token-ttl-seconds" = "21600"} -Method PUT –Uri http://169.254.169.254/latest/api/token
```

```
PS C:\> Invoke-RestMethod -Headers @{"X-aws-ec2-metadata-token" = $token} -Method GET -Uri http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/
```

------
#### [ IMDSv1 ]

```
PS C:\> Invoke-RestMethod -uri http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/
```

------

If you don't want to use PowerShell, you can install a third\-party tool such as GNU Wget or cURL\.

**Important**  
If you do install a third\-party tool on a Windows instance, ensure that you read the accompanying documentation carefully, as the method of calling the HTTP and the output format might be different from what is documented here\.

### Responses and Error Messages<a name="instance-metadata-returns"></a>

All instance metadata is returned as text \(HTTP content type `text/plain`\)\.

A request for a specific metadata resource returns the appropriate value, or a `404 - Not Found` HTTP error code if the resource is not available\. 

A request for a general metadata resource \(the URI ends with a /\) returns a list of available resources, or a `404 - Not Found` HTTP error code if there is no such resource\. The list items are on separate lines, terminated by line feeds \(ASCII 10\)\.

For requests made using Instance Metadata Service Version 2, the following HTTP error codes can be returned:
+ `400 - Missing or Invalid Parameters` – The `PUT` request is not valid\.
+ `401 - Unauthorized` – The `GET` request uses an invalid token\. The recommended action is to generate a new token\.
+ `403 - Forbidden` – The request is not allowed or the instance metadata service is turned off\.

### Throttling<a name="instancedata-throttling"></a>

We throttle queries to the instance metadata service on a per\-instance basis, and we place limits on the number of simultaneous connections from an instance to the instance metadata service\. 

If you're using the instance metadata service to retrieve AWS security credentials, avoid querying for credentials during every transaction or concurrently from a high number of threads or processes, as this might lead to throttling\. Instead, we recommend that you cache the credentials until they start approaching their expiry time\. 

If you are throttled while accessing the instance metadata service, retry your query with an exponential backoff strategy\.

### Limiting Instance Metadata Service Access<a name="instance-metadata-limiting-access"></a>

You can consider using local firewall rules to disable access from some or all processes to the instance metadata service\.

**Using Windows firewall to limit access**

The following PowerShell example uses the built\-in Windows firewall to prevent the Internet Information Server webserver \(based on its default installation user ID of `NT AUTHORITY\IUSR`\) from accessing 169\.254\.169\.254\. It uses a *deny rule* to reject all instance metadata requests \(whether IMDSv1 or IMDSv2\) from any process running as that user\.

```
PS C:\> $blockPrincipal = New-Object -TypeName System.Security.Principal.NTAccount ("NT AUTHORITY\IUSR")
PS C:\> $BlockPrincipalSID = $blockPrincipal.Translate([System.Security.Principal.SecurityIdentifier]).Value
PS C:\> $BlockPrincipalSDDL = "D:(A;;CC;;;$PrincipalSID)"
PS C:\> New-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName "Block metadata service from IIS" -Action block -Direction out `
-Protocol TCP -RemoteAddress 169.254.169.254 -LocalUser $BlockPrincipalSDDL
```

Or, you can consider only allowing access to particular users or groups, by using *allow rules*\. Allow rules might be easier to manage from a security perspective, because they require you to make a decision about what software needs access to instance metadata\. If you use *allow rules*, it's less likely you will accidentally allow software to access the metadata service \(that you did not intend to have access\) if you later change the software or configuration on an instance\. You can also combine group usage with allow rules, so that you can add and remove users from a permitted group without needing to change the firewall rule\.

The following example prevents access to instance metadata by all processes running as an OS group specified in the variable `blockPrincipal` \(in this example, the Windows group `Everyone`\), except for processes specified in `exceptionPrincipal` \(in this example, a group called `trustworthy-users`\)\. You must specify both deny and allow principals because Windows Firewall, unlike the `! --uid-owner trustworthy-user` rule in Linux iptables, does not provide a shortcut mechanism to allow only a particular principal \(user or group\) by denying all the others\.

```
PS C:\> $blockPrincipal = New-Object -TypeName System.Security.Principal.NTAccount ("Everyone")
PS C:\> $BlockPrincipalSID = $blockPrincipal.Translate([System.Security.Principal.SecurityIdentifier]).Value
PS C:\> $exceptionPrincipal = New-Object -TypeName System.Security.Principal.NTAccount ("trustworthy-users")
PS C:\> $ExceptionPrincipalSID = $exceptionPrincipal.Translate([System.Security.Principal.SecurityIdentifier]).Value
PS C:\> $PrincipalSDDL = "O:LSD:(D;;CC;;;$ExceptionPrincipalSID)(A;;CC;;;$BlockPrincipalSID)"
PS C:\> New-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName "Block metadata service for $($blockPrincipal.Value), exception: $($exceptionPrincipal.Value)" -Action block -Direction out `
-Protocol TCP -RemoteAddress 169.254.169.254 -LocalUser $PrincipalSDDL
```

**Note**  
To use local firewall rules, you need to adapt the preceding example commands to suit your needs\. 

**Using netsh rules to limit access**

You can consider blocking all software using `netsh` rules, but those are much less flexible\.

```
C:\> netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="Block metadata service altogether" dir=out protocol=TCP remoteip=169.254.169.254 action=block
```

**Note**  
To use local firewall rules, you need to adapt the preceding example commands to suit your needs\. 
`netsh` rules must be set from an elevated command prompt, and can’t be set to deny or allow particular principals\.

## Working with Instance User Data<a name="instancedata-add-user-data"></a>

When working with instance user data, keep the following in mind:
+ User data must be base64\-encoded\. The Amazon EC2 console can perform the base64\-encoding for you or accept base64\-encoded input\.
+ User data is limited to 16 KB, in raw form, before it is base64\-encoded\. The size of a string of length *n* after base64\-encoding is ceil\(*n*/3\)\*4\.
+ User data must be base64\-decoded when you retrieve it\. If you retrieve the data using instance metadata or the console, it's decoded for you automatically\.
+ User data is treated as opaque data: what you give is what you get back\. It is up to the instance to be able to interpret it\.
+ If you stop an instance, modify its user data, and start the instance, the updated user data is not executed automatically when you start the instance\. However, you can configure settings so that updated user data scripts are executed one time when you start the instance or every time you reboot or start the instance\.

### Specify Instance User Data at Launch<a name="specify-user-data-launch"></a>

You can specify user data when you launch an instance\. You can specify that the user data is executed one time at launch, or every time you reboot or start the instance\. For more information, see [Running Commands on Your Windows Instance at Launch](ec2-windows-user-data.md)\.

### Modify Instance User Data<a name="modify-user-data-run"></a>

You can modify user data for an instance in the stopped state if the root volume is an EBS volume\. For more information, see [View and Update the Instance User Data](ec2-windows-user-data.md#user-data-view-change)\.

### Retrieve Instance User Data<a name="instancedata-user-data-retrieval"></a>

To retrieve user data from within a running instance, use the following URI\.

```
http://169.254.169.254/latest/user-data
```

A request for user data returns the data as it is \(content type `application/octet-stream`\)\. 

This example returns user data that was provided as comma\-separated text\.

## Instance Metadata Categories<a name="instancedata-data-categories"></a>

The following table lists the categories of instance metadata\.

**Important**  
Category names that are formatted in red text are placeholders for data that is unique to your instance; for example, *mac* represents the MAC address for the network interface\. You must replace the placeholders with the actual values\.
