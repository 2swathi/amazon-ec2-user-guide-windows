# General Purpose Instances<a name="general-purpose-instances"></a>

General purpose instances provide a balance of compute, memory, and networking resources, and can be used for a variety of workloads\.

**M5, M5a, and M5d Instances**

These instances provide an ideal cloud infrastructure, offering a balance of compute, memory, and networking resources for a broad range of applications that are deployed in the cloud\. M5 instances are well\-suited for the following applications:
+ Web and application servers
+ Small and medium databases
+ Gaming servers
+ Caching fleets
+ Running backend servers for SAP, Microsoft SharePoint, cluster computing, and other enterprise applications

**T2 and T3 Instances**

These instances provide a baseline level of CPU performance with the ability to burst to a higher level when required by your workload\. An Unlimited instance can sustain high CPU performance for any period of time whenever required\. For more information, see [Burstable Performance Instances](burstable-performance-instances.md)\. These instances are well\-suited for the following applications:
+ Websites and web applications
+ Code repositories
+ Development, build, test, and staging environments
+ Microservices

## Instance Performance<a name="general-purpose-performance"></a>

EBS\-optimized instances enable you to get consistently high performance for your EBS volumes by eliminating contention between Amazon EBS I/O and other network traffic from your instance\. Some general purpose instances are EBS\-optimized by default at no additional cost\. For more information, see [Amazon EBSâ€“Optimized Instances](EBSOptimized.md)\.

## Network Performance<a name="general-purpose-network-performance"></a>

You can enable enhanced networking capabilities on supported instance types\. Enhanced networking provides significantly higher packet\-per\-second \(PPS\) performance, lower network jitter, and lower latencies\. For more information, see [Enhanced Networking on Windows](enhanced-networking.md)\.

Instance types that use the Elastic Network Adapter \(ENA\) for enhanced networking deliver high packet per second performance with consistently low latencies\. Most applications do not consistently need a high level of network performance, but can benefit from having access to increased bandwidth when they send or receive data\. Instance types that use the ENA and support up to 10 Gbps of throughput use a network I/O credit mechanism to allocate network bandwidth to instances based on average bandwidth utilization\. These instances accrue credits when their network throughput is below their baseline limits, and can use these credits when they perform network data transfers\. For workloads that require access to 10 Gbps of bandwidth or more on a sustained basis, we recommend using instance types that support 10 Gbps or 25 Gbps network speeds\.

The following is a summary of network performance for general purpose instances that support enhanced networking\.


| Instance type | Network performance | Enhanced networking | 
| --- | --- | --- | 
| t2\.nano, t2\.micro, t2\.small, t2\.medium, t2\.large, t2\.xlarge, t2\.2xlarge | Up to 1 Gbps |  | 
| t3\.nano, t3\.micro, t3\.small, t3\.medium, t3\.large, t3\.xlarge, t3\.2xlarge  | Up to 5 Gbps | [ENA](enhanced-networking-ena.md) | 
|  `m4.large`  |  Moderate  |  [Intel 82599 VF](sriov-networking.md)  | 
|  `m4.xlarge`, `m4.2xlarge`, `m4.4xlarge`  |  High  |  [Intel 82599 VF](sriov-networking.md)  | 
|  `m5.large`, `m5.xlarge`, `m5.2xlarge`, `m5.4xlarge`, `m5a.large`, `m5a.xlarge`, `m5a.2xlarge`, `m5a.4xlarge`, `m5d.large`, `m5d.xlarge`, `m5d.2xlarge`, `m5d.4xlarge`  |  Up to 10 Gbps  | [ENA](enhanced-networking-ena.md) | 
|  `m4.10xlarge`  |  10 Gbps  |  [Intel 82599 VF](sriov-networking.md)  | 
|  `m5.12xlarge`, `m5a.12xlarge`, `m5d.12xlarge`  |  10 Gbps  | [ENA](enhanced-networking-ena.md) | 
|  `m5a.24xlarge`  |  20 Gbps  | [ENA](enhanced-networking-ena.md) | 
|  `m4.16xlarge`, `m5.24xlarge`, `m5d.24xlarge`  |  25 Gbps  | [ENA](enhanced-networking-ena.md) | 

## SSD I/O Performance<a name="general-purpose-ssd-perf"></a>

If you use all the SSD\-based instance store volumes available to your instance, you get the IOPS \(4,096 byte block size\) performance listed in the following table \(at queue depth saturation\)\. Otherwise, you get lower IOPS performance\.


| Instance Size | 100% Random Read IOPS | Write IOPS | 
| --- | --- | --- | 
|  `m5d.large` \*  |  30,000  |  15,000  | 
|  `m5d.xlarge` \*  |  59,000  |  29,000  | 
|  `m5d.2xlarge` \*  |  117,000  |  57,000  | 
|  `m5d.4xlarge` \*  |  234,000  |  114,000  | 
|  `m5d.12xlarge`  |  700,000  |  340,000  | 
|  `m5d.24xlarge`  |  1,400,000  |  680,000  | 

\* For these instances, you can get up to the specified performance\.

As you fill the SSD\-based instance store volumes for your instance, the number of write IOPS that you can achieve decreases\. This is due to the extra work the SSD controller must do to find available space, rewrite existing data, and erase unused space so that it can be rewritten\. This process of garbage collection results in internal write amplification to the SSD, expressed as the ratio of SSD write operations to user write operations\. This decrease in performance is even larger if the write operations are not in multiples of 4,096 bytes or not aligned to a 4,096\-byte boundary\. If you write a smaller amount of bytes or bytes that are not aligned, the SSD controller must read the surrounding data and store the result in a new location\. This pattern results in significantly increased write amplification, increased latency, and dramatically reduced I/O performance\.

SSD controllers can use several strategies to reduce the impact of write amplification\. One such strategy is to reserve space in the SSD instance storage so that the controller can more efficiently manage the space available for write operations\. This is called *over\-provisioning*\. The SSD\-based instance store volumes provided to an instance don't have any space reserved for over\-provisioning\. To reduce write amplification, we recommend that you leave 10% of the volume unpartitioned so that the SSD controller can use it for over\-provisioning\. This decreases the storage that you can use, but increases performance even if the disk is close to full capacity\.

For instance store volumes that support TRIM, you can use the TRIM command to notify the SSD controller whenever you no longer need data that you've written\. This provides the controller with more free space, which can reduce write amplification and increase performance\. For more information, see [Instance Store Volume TRIM Support](ssd-instance-store.md#InstanceStoreTrimSupport)\.

## Release Notes<a name="general-purpose-instances-limits"></a>
+ M5, M5d, and T3 instances feature a 3\.1 GHz Intel Xeon Platinum 8000 series processor\.
+ M5a instances feature a 2\.5 GHz AMD EPYC 7000 series processor\.
+ M4, M5, M5a, M5d, `t2.large` and larger, and `t3.large` and larger instance types require 64\-bit HVM AMIs\. They have high\-memory, and require a 64\-bit operating system to take advantage of that capacity\. HVM AMIs provide superior performance in comparison to paravirtual \(PV\) AMIs on high\-memory instance types\. In addition, you must use an HVM AMI to take advantage of enhanced networking\.
+ M5, M5a, M5d, and T3 instances have the following requirements:
  + Must have the NVMe drivers installed\. EBS volumes are exposed as [NVMe block devices](nvme-ebs-volumes.md)\.
  + Must have the Elastic Network Adapter \([ENA](enhanced-networking-ena.md)\) drivers installed\.

  The following AMIs meet these requirements:
  + Amazon Linux 2
  + Amazon Linux AMI 2014\.03 or later
  + Ubuntu 14\.04 or later
  + SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12 or later
  + Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7\.4 or later
  + CentOS 7 or later
  + FreeBSD 11\.1\-RELEASE
  + Windows Server 2008 R2 or later
+ M5, M5a, M5d, and T3 instances support a maximum of 28 attachments, including network interfaces, EBS volumes, and NVMe instance store volumes\. Every instance has at least one network interface attachment\. For example, if you have no additional network interface attachments on an EBS\-only instance, you could attach 27 EBS volumes to that instance\.
+ There is a limit on the total number of instances that you can launch in a region, and there are additional limits on some instance types\.
