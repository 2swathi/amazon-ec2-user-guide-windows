## Instance Performance<a name="compute-performance"></a>

EBS\-optimized instances enable you to get consistently high performance for your EBS volumes by eliminating contention between Amazon EBS I/O and other network traffic from your instance\. Some compute optimized instances are EBS\-optimized by default at no additional cost\. For more information, see [Amazon EBSâ€“Optimized Instances](EBSOptimized.md)\.

## Network Performance<a name="compute-network-performance"></a>

You can enable enhanced networking capabilities on supported instance types\. Enhanced networking provides significantly higher packet\-per\-second \(PPS\) performance, lower network jitter, and lower latencies\. For more information, see [Enhanced Networking on Windows](enhanced-networking.md)\.

Instance types that use the Elastic Network Adapter \(ENA\) for enhanced networking deliver high packet per second performance with consistently low latencies\. Most applications do not consistently need a high level of network performance, but can benefit from having access to increased bandwidth when they send or receive data\. Instance sizes that use the ENA and are documented with network performance of "Up to 10 Gbps" or "Up to 25 Gbps" use a network I/O credit mechanism to allocate network bandwidth to instances based on average bandwidth utilization\. These instances accrue credits when their network bandwidth is below their baseline limits, and can use these credits when they perform network data transfers\.

The following is a summary of network performance for compute optimized instances that support enhanced networking\.


****  

| Instance type | Network performance | Enhanced networking | 
| --- | --- | --- | 
|  `c5.4xlarge` and smaller \| `c5d.4xlarge` and smaller  | Up to 10 Gbps | [ENA](enhanced-networking-ena.md) | 
| c5\.9xlarge \| c5d\.9xlarge | 10 Gbps | [ENA](enhanced-networking-ena.md) | 
| c5n\.4xlarge and smaller | Up to 25 Gbps | [ENA](enhanced-networking-ena.md) | 
| c5\.18xlarge \| c5d\.18xlarge | 25 Gbps | [ENA](enhanced-networking-ena.md) | 
| c5n\.9xlarge | 50 Gbps | [ENA](enhanced-networking-ena.md) | 
| c5n\.18xlarge | 100 Gbps | [ENA](enhanced-networking-ena.md) | 
| c4\.large | Moderate | [Intel 82599 VF](sriov-networking.md) | 
| c4\.xlarge \| c4\.2xlarge \| c4\.4xlarge | High | [Intel 82599 VF](sriov-networking.md) | 
| c4\.8xlarge | 10 Gbps | [Intel 82599 VF](sriov-networking.md) | 

## SSD I/O Performance<a name="compute-ssd-perf"></a>

If you use all the SSD\-based instance store volumes available to your instance, you get the IOPS \(4,096 byte block size\) performance listed in the following table \(at queue depth saturation\)\. Otherwise, you get lower IOPS performance\.


| Instance Size | 100% Random Read IOPS | Write IOPS | 
| --- | --- | --- | 
|  `c5d.large` \*  |  20,000  |  9,000  | 
|  `c5d.xlarge` \*  |  40,000  |  18,000  | 
|  `c5d.2xlarge` \*  |  80,000  |  37,000  | 
|  `c5d.4xlarge` \*  |  175,000  |  75,000  | 
|  `c5d.9xlarge`  |  350,000  |  170,000  | 
|  `c5d.18xlarge`  |  700,000  |  340,000  | 

\* For these instances, you can get up to the specified performance\.

As you fill the SSD\-based instance store volumes for your instance, the number of write IOPS that you can achieve decreases\. This is due to the extra work the SSD controller must do to find available space, rewrite existing data, and erase unused space so that it can be rewritten\. This process of garbage collection results in internal write amplification to the SSD, expressed as the ratio of SSD write operations to user write operations\. This decrease in performance is even larger if the write operations are not in multiples of 4,096 bytes or not aligned to a 4,096\-byte boundary\. If you write a smaller amount of bytes or bytes that are not aligned, the SSD controller must read the surrounding data and store the result in a new location\. This pattern results in significantly increased write amplification, increased latency, and dramatically reduced I/O performance\.

SSD controllers can use several strategies to reduce the impact of write amplification\. One such strategy is to reserve space in the SSD instance storage so that the controller can more efficiently manage the space available for write operations\. This is called *over\-provisioning*\. The SSD\-based instance store volumes provided to an instance don't have any space reserved for over\-provisioning\. To reduce write amplification, we recommend that you leave 10% of the volume unpartitioned so that the SSD controller can use it for over\-provisioning\. This decreases the storage that you can use, but increases performance even if the disk is close to full capacity\.

For instance store volumes that support TRIM, you can use the TRIM command to notify the SSD controller whenever you no longer need data that you've written\. This provides the controller with more free space, which can reduce write amplification and increase performance\. For more information, see [Instance Store Volume TRIM Support](ssd-instance-store.md#InstanceStoreTrimSupport)\.

## Release Notes<a name="compute-instance-limits"></a>
+ C4, C5, C5d, and C5n instances require 64\-bit EBS\-backed HVM AMIs\. They have high\-memory and require a 64\-bit operating system to take advantage of that capacity\. HVM AMIs provide superior performance in comparison to paravirtual \(PV\) AMIs on high\-memory instance types\. In addition, you must use an HVM AMI to take advantage of enhanced networking\.
+ C5, C5d, and C5n instances have the following requirements:
  + NVMe drivers must be installed\. EBS volumes are exposed as [NVMe block devices](nvme-ebs-volumes.md)\.
  + Elastic Network Adapter \([ENA](enhanced-networking-ena.md)\) drivers must be installed\.

  The following AMIs meet these requirements:
  + Amazon Linux 2
  + Amazon Linux AMI 2018\.03
  + Ubuntu 14\.04 or later
  + Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7\.4 or later
  + SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12 SP2 or later
  + CentOS 7 or later
  + FreeBSD 11\.1 or later
+ C5, C5d, and C5n instances support a maximum of 28 attachments, including network interfaces, EBS volumes, and NVMe instance store volumes\. Every instance has at least one network interface attachment\.
+ There is a limit on the total number of instances that you can launch in a region, and there are additional limits on some instance types\.
