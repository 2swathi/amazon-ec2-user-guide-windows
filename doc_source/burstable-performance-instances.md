# Burstable Performance Instances<a name="burstable-performance-instances"></a>

Burstable performance instances, which include [T3 and T2 instances](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/), are designed to provide a baseline level of CPU performance with the ability to burst to a higher level when required by your workload\. Burstable performance instances are well suited for a wide range of general\-purpose applications\. Examples include microservices, low\-latency interactive applications, small and medium databases, virtual desktops, development, build, and stage environments, code repositories, and product prototypes\.

T3 and T2 are the only instance types that use credits for CPU usage\. For more information about T3 and T2 instance pricing and additional hardware details, see [Amazon EC2 Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/) and [Amazon EC2 Instance Types](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/)\.

If your account is less than 12 months old, you can use a `t2.micro` instance for free within certain usage limits\. For more information, see [AWS Free Tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free/)\.

## Burstable Performance Instance Requirements<a name="burstable-performance-instances-limits"></a>

The following are the requirements for T3 and T2 instances:
+ T3 and T2 instances are available as On\-Demand Instances, Reserved Instances, and Spot Instances, but not as Scheduled Instances or Dedicated Instances\. They are also not supported on a Dedicated Host\. For more information, see [Instance Purchasing Options](instance-purchasing-options.md)\.
+ There is a limit on the total number of instances that you can launch in an AWS Region, and there are additional limits on some instance types\. By default, you can run up to 20 T3 and 20 T2 instances simultaneously\. If you need more instances, request them using the [Amazon EC2 Instance Request Form](https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home#/case/create?issueType=service-limit-increase&limitType=service-code-ec2-instances)\.
+ Ensure that the T3 or T2 instance size you choose passes the minimum memory requirements of your operating system and applications\. Operating systems with graphical user interfaces that consume significant memory and CPU resources \(for example, Windows\) may require a `t2.micro` or larger instance size for many use cases\. As the memory and CPU requirements of your workload grow over time, you can scale to larger T3 or T2 instance sizes, or other EC2 instance types\.

## Best Practices<a name="burstable-performance-instances-best-practices"></a>

Follow these best practices to get the maximum benefit from T3 and T2 instances\.
+ **Use a recommended AMI** – Use an AMI that provides the required drivers\. For more information, see [Release Notes](general-purpose-instances.md#general-purpose-instances-limits)\.
+ **Turn on instance recovery** – Create a CloudWatch alarm that monitors an EC2 instance and automatically recovers it if it becomes impaired for any reason\. For more information, see [Adding Recover Actions to Amazon CloudWatch Alarms](UsingAlarmActions.md#AddingRecoverActions)\.
