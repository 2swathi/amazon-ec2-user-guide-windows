# Amazon EC2 Service Limits<a name="ec2-resource-limits"></a>

Amazon EC2 provides different *resources* that you can use\. These resources include images, instances, volumes, and snapshots\. When you create your AWS account, we set default limits on these resources on a per\-region basis\. For example, there is a limit on the number of instances that you can launch in a region\. Therefore, when you launch an instance in the US West \(Oregon\) region, the request must not cause your usage to exceed your current instance limit in that region\.

The Amazon EC2 console provides limit information for the resources managed by the Amazon EC2 and Amazon VPC consoles\. You can request an increase for many of these limits\. Use the limit information that we provide to manage your AWS infrastructure\. Plan to request any limit increases in advance of the time that you'll need them\.

For more information about the limits for other services, see [AWS Service Limits](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_service_limits.html) in the *Amazon Web Services General Reference*\.
